## Origin

> Organization founded on: 2023-02-27

Looking ahead to 2023, there are big names in Bilibili [@Diemit](https://space.bilibili.com/1570309), [@AlgoIdeas](https://space.bilibili.com/36549646) and [@Wathinst](https://space.bilibili.com/384743347) who have ported OpenHarmony to old phones such as Xiaomi 6, OnePlus 6T, PocoF1. For details, please refer to here: [awesome-ohos-org](https://gitee.com/ohos-dev/awesome-ohos-org). After that, there is a big news about [OpenHarmony on PC](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/486o6HZyvi0jqyivPnr6lQ). Maybe the development of OpenHarmony is destined to become an important part of localization technology.

OpenHarmony is growing rapidly. Although it has a complete application development system since API 9, there are few open source application software. I think one of the main reasons is that there are too few and expensive standard system development boards for official support and third-party porting and adaptation. Without cheap development boards or other alternative solutions such as porting from old phones, and without the participation of developers in the co-construction of open source software, the entire ecosystem of OpenHarmony will remain incomplete

With the passage of time, the 2023 HDC conference and the release of the preview version of HarmonyOS Next seem to have made the next step clearer. I believe that in the near future, we will see a brand-new OpenHarmony ecosystem, and the future of OpenHarmony is coming!

## Development

### 2023-02-27

- The organization was established and named "OHOS Dev".

### 2023-11-25

- The organization officially changed its name to "开鸿派".
- All repositories were transferred to the original author's account, and attempts were made to establish a new order. For a list of open source projects, please refer to here: [awesome-ohos-project](https://gitee.com/ohos-dev/awesome-ohos-project)
- Launched a newly designed LOGO (the circle and background colors of the [**F-OH**](https://github.com/westinyang/f-oh) icon are swapped, and the homophonic word "π" for pie also means infinite possibilities~)

## Vision

- Encourage more developers to participate in the co-construction of OHOS open source application software
- Expand the ecosystem and influence of OHOS systems and application software
- See OHOS fully bloom in future localization technology coverage areas
