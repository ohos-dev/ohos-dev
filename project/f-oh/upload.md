# Upload Application

::: tip
F-OH only includes free and open-source software. "Free software must be open-source, but open-source software may not necessarily be free. Some open-source licenses are too strict for users, so they are not classified as free software." Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), wrote in an answer: ["Why open source misses the point of free software?"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.zh-cn.html).

In the early stages of development, in order to minimize the investment costs of backend development and servers, a self-built Git service was temporarily used to collaboratively manage the application's metadata.
